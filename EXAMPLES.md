# Universa Examples

## Document Meta

- Purpose: Explain how to set up and run the Universa framework examples.
- Audience: Contributors and maintainers working on Universa internals.
- Status: Active

## Overview

The `examples/` directory contains nine framework examples that each show a working Universa integration with the `example` overlay package. Each example starts its own dev server with the example bridge mounted, so the overlay appears in the browser and connects to a local example runtime.

| ID          | Framework  | Default port |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| `react`     | React      | 4600         |
| `vue`       | Vue        | 4601         |
| `sveltekit` | SvelteKit  | 4602         |
| `solid`     | Solid      | 4603         |
| `astro`     | Astro      | 4604         |
| `nextjs`    | Next.js    | 4605         |
| `nuxt`      | Nuxt       | 4606         |
| `vanilla`   | Vanilla JS | 4607         |
| `vinext`    | Vinext     | 4608         |

The runner assigns ports sequentially starting at `4600`. If one is already in use, it picks the next available port and continues from there.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — used for the workspace, scripts, and running examples
- Node.js 20 or 22 — required by some framework dev servers

## First-Time Setup

Run the setup script once from the repository root. It installs workspace dependencies and builds the `universa-kit` and `example` packages that the examples depend on.

```bash
bun run examples:setup
```

This runs the following steps in order:

1. `bun install` — installs all workspace dependencies
2. `bun run build` — builds the `universa-kit` package
3. `bun run build` in `packages/example` — builds the `example` overlay package

After setup completes, no further build steps are needed to run examples unless source files change (see [Rebuilding after source changes](#rebuilding-after-source-changes)).

### Force re-linking workspace packages

```bash
bun run examples:setup --force
```

Adds a `bun install --force` step after the initial build, which re-links all workspace packages. Use this if examples fail to resolve workspace packages correctly (e.g. after switching branches, pulling changes, or when Bun's workspace cache is stale).

## Running Examples

### All examples

```bash
bun run examples
```

Starts all nine framework dev servers concurrently. URLs are printed to the terminal as each server becomes ready. Browser tabs open automatically.

### Specific examples

```bash
bun run examples react nextjs
bun run examples vinext
bun run examples vue sveltekit astro
```

Pass one or more example IDs (from the table above) as arguments. Only the specified servers start.

### Without opening browser tabs

```bash
bun run examples --no-open
bun run examples react nextjs --no-open
```

Servers start normally but no browser tabs are opened.

## Verifying Examples

```bash
bun run verify:examples
```

Checks each example's health and bridge state endpoints (`/__universa/example/health` and `/__universa/example/state`) and reports pass/fail per example. Requires all examples to be running.

## Rebuilding after source changes

When `src/` (Universa core) or `packages/example/src/` (example overlay) changes, rebuild before running examples:

```bash
# Rebuild universa-kit
bun run build

# Rebuild example overlay
bun run build --filter=example

# Or run setup again to rebuild both
bun run examples:setup
```

Individual examples do not need rebuilding — they import the packages directly from the workspace.

## Example Structure

Each example lives under `examples/<id>/` and follows the same pattern:

- Standard framework project (Next.js app router, SvelteKit, Astro, etc.)
- `example` package wired in via factory preset creation (`example()`) and adapter methods (`example().vite()`, `example().next(...)`, `example().astro()`, `example().nuxt()`)
- No framework-level `example/overlay` import is required; overlay mounting is handled by the `example` integration/runtime automatically
- Shared UI components from `examples/shared/ui/` (`example-ui` workspace package)

### Vinext, Solid, and Nuxt notes

Vinext and Solid both use the Vite adapter (`example().vite()`) directly because they run on Vite dev servers. Vinext additionally includes `resolve.dedupe` for React packages and `optimizeDeps.include` for `react-server-dom-webpack` to prevent Bun workspace resolution issues. See `examples/vinext/vite.config.ts`.

Nuxt runs with `--no-fork` in the examples runner to avoid dev worker restart loops (`ECONNRESET`) during multi-example runs.

## Shared UI package

`examples/shared/ui/` is the `example-ui` workspace package. It exports:

- `example-ui/styles.css` — base page styles
- `example-ui/theme` — `getInitialTheme`, `applyTheme`, `toggleTheme`
- `example-ui/bridge` — `phaseBadgeClass`, `transportBadgeClass` badge helpers

## Notes

- The `--port` flag is passed automatically by the runner; examples do not need to hard-code ports.
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all running servers.
